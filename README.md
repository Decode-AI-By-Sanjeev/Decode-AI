## Description

Welcome to Decode AI â€“ where we simplify the path to landing roles like Applied Scientist, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer at MAANG and other top tech companies.

We're not just another tutorial channel. We are a team of IIT alumni and having experience from Google, NVIDIA, Samsung Research, Oracle, Flipkart, and more. Having walked the path ourselves, we noticed a massive gap between what's taught on platforms like YouTube and EdTech Courses â€” and what top companies actually test for.

ðŸŽ¯ Our Key Focus:
- Deep dives into ML, Deep Learning, System Design, and Research Papers
- End-to-end guidance to break into top AI roles
- Coding, problem-solving, and project walkthroughs
- Real interview prep strategies and case studies
- Insider tips from those whoâ€™ve cracked the toughest interviews

Subscribe and start decoding your future in AI.
